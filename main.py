""" CSC111: MealMate (Final Project) by Evan Wang and Isabella Nguyen
Project Description
===============================
Sometimes it gets difficult to choose what to eat throughout the day, especially with all options
available in Toronto. Deciding what to eat, commuting, then finding a spot to eat can be
time-consuming. Food delivery apps are an option, but they tend to be expensive. As university students,
we want to save some money so we should opt to cook sometimes instead.
Sometimes students want something new but it is difficult to explore new recipes and meals
because we do not want to spend hours scrolling through recipe pages and students want to
use up what is left in their fridges. So our question was, How can we recommend a meal
based on user preferences? Including their past favourites, ratings.
preferred cooking time, and any ingredients they want to use.
